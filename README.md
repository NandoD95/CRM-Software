## Generating Your Environment

You might have noticed in the file structure- there's already a Pipfile!

Install any additional dependencies you know you'll need for your project by
adding them to the `Pipfile`. Then run the commands:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

### What Goes into a README?

This README serves as a template. Replace the contents of this file to describe
the important files in your project and describe what they do. Each Python file
that you edit should get at least a paragraph, and each function should be
described with a sentence or two.

Describe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of detail. The rest
should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably functions next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
